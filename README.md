# My Projects developed during Global Game Jam 2023

Theme was Roots

see https://v3.globalgamejam.org/2023/games

## I took part in polyjam

On site jam in Warsaw, Poland organised by Polygon students organisation

## I developped those on rapsbery pie

I took a rapsbery pie as main development and runtime machine :) and tried develloping something in pygame I had very basic understanding of

Games are crap but i had fun. Internet browser barely worked on the pie as it was too weak :) but simple python ide that came preinstalled on the pie was reasonably usable with pygame.

I restarted game design twice during 24h jam making 3 different small projects :), as my 2 initial projects were not fun to play at all

For the 3td project I coded bazier curves that i had in mind for ages but couldnt get myself to code them :)

And went with a simple action game so it is much more playable than puzzle games i tried to create as 1st and 2nd project
